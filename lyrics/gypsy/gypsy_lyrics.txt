Broke my heart on the road
Spent the weekends sewing the pieces back on
Crayons and dolls pass me by
Walking gets too boring when you learn how to fly
Not the homecoming kind
Take the top off, and who knows what you might find
Won't confess all my sins
You can bet all trying, but you can't always win
'Cause I'm a gypsy, are you coming with me?
I might steal your clothes and wear them if they fit me
Never made agreements just like a gypsy
And I won't back down 'cause life's already bit me
And I won't cry, I'm too young to die
If you're gon' quit me
'Cause I'm a gypsy
'Cause I'm a gypsy
I can't hide what I've done
Scars remind me of just how far that I've come
To whom it may concern
Only run with scissors when you want to get hurt
'Cause I'm a gypsy, are youâ€¦
